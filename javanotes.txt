1.Java Fundamentals Programming

What  is Java?
Java is a Programming Language which uses OOP's Approach.

What makes Java so Popular?
Simple,Robust,Distributed,Platform Independent/Portable


What kind of Application can be ddeveloped Using Java.
Desktop App,Network,Districbuted app,Web,Mobile,Enterprise,Animation,Gui.


What are the Versions

Jdk1.0--->1995
Jdk1.1--->1997
Jdk1.2--->1998
Jdk1.3--->2000
Jdk1.4--->2002
Jdk1.5--->2004
Jdk1.6--->2006
Jdk1.7--->2011
Jdk1.8--->2014


Why Java8?
Lambda Expression,Functional Programming,Date&Time,Streams,functional Interfaces
Less Amout of Code.



Fundamentals:

1. DataTypes : Primitive Types and Referenced Types(Non-Primitive)


Primitive Types: they have fixed size
int,float,double,long,short,byte,char,boolean

Referenced Types(Non-Primitive)
String
Interface
Abstract class
Userdefine class


2. Operators
Arithmetic
Relation Operators

3. Keywords: 60 Keywords

int,float,double,long,short,byte,char,boolean,class,interface,abstarct,extends implements,import,if ,else




4. Control Statements

Conditional Statments
1. if,if-else,if-else if,switch
1.1 break,continue

Iteratave Statements
while,dowhile,for,for-each(from java1.5)



Syntax of Java

class   Demo
{

public static void main(String a[])
{

}
}
******************************************
Syntax of c++
class   <classname>
{
};
void main()
{

}



Where do i write the Java Code?
Notepad,IDE(Eclipse,Intellij,Netbeans)


Rules for Execution of Java Code.

1.Use a editor
2. Write the code
3. Save the code with a filename having an extension ".java"
4. Compile the Code ----> javac filename.java
5.Execute The Code----> java classnamewhichcontainsmainmethod


What are the rules to be followed?

1.In a file you can have any number of classes
2.In a file you can have any number of classes but only one class should be declared public
3.We can have classname and filename different if the class is not declared public


How do i print and output using Java

In c---->printf
in c++--->cout
in Java----> System.out.println


Understanding System.out.println?


System.out.println();


println();----> is a function/method
out------> is a reference of PrintStream class in java
System-----> is a class in java


Where are these present?
ALL Libraries in c,c++ are present in header files(stdio.h)---->  # include

ALL Libraries in java are present in packages

Note :All basic libraries are present in java.lang

How to use this packages?

These packages are used by using a keyword  "import"

ex: import  java.lang.*;

Do we need to import this lang package?
No necessary



What is the purpose of static.

static is a keyword
static can be applied to varaible,methods,classes
static members are independent members of the class
static members can be accessed anywhere using the classname
static members are shared across multiple objects in the memory(ie static members will be allocated space in the memory only once)




OOP in Java?
1. Anything which can developed and implemented in Programming and which has its existance in real world

2. If anything is existing it meaans it will have state and behaviour is called Object

state---> attributes
behaviour--->functionalty

Ex:
Watch:
state: size,colour,price,brandname,shape
beahiuors:showTime,ringandalarm,


Lets say go ahead and develop this programmatically

class Watch
{


int size,
String colour,
double price,
String brandname

void showTime()
{

}

void ringandalarm()
{
}


}


What is the Use of OOPS?
1. Encapsulation: hiding important members 
2.Abstraction: exposing only the required members of a class
3. Inhertianc: resubality,place and arrange the object in heirarchy 
5.Polymorphisim: u can make and object play different roles at differnt places

 How is this done?
Using Access specfiers
private,public,protected

Encapsulation: private access
Abstraction:public
